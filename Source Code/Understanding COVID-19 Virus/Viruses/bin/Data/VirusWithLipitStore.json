[{"Infection":"In addition to nucleic acid and capsid, SARS-CoV-2 has an envelope layer containing four types of proteins: spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), and nucleocapsid (N) protein.","Type":"Enveloped Virus","Introduction":"SARS-CoV-2 is a type of single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with an enveloped structure, exhibiting a diameter of 60\u2013140 nm and long spikes measuring 9\u201312 nm (Figure 1). It belongs to the betacoronavirus genus, which includes MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV","Individual":"While the ACE2 cell surface molecule was initially identified as a prominent receptor bound by the spike protein, subsequent cell surface molecules have been proposed to act as alternative or co-receptors, including KIM1, AXL, L-SIGN, DC-SIGN, and SR-B1. For most of these molecules, it remains unclear whether they serve as true substitutes for ACE2 or if their activity is limited in facilitating viral entry.","LinkImage":"\/Screen\/XML\/Image\/Sars-covi2.jpg","Id":1,"LinkImage2":"\/Screen\/XML\/Image\/Sars-covi2_LifeCycle.jpg","Structure":"Nucleic Acid + Capsid","LinkVideo":"Viruses\/src\/Data\/Video\/1.mp4","Name":"Sars-Covi 2"},{"Infection":"The immune-suppressing virus in humans has a diameter ranging from 80 to 140 nanometers, with a cuboid shape composed of 20 faces. The outer layer of the virus is a lipid envelope derived from the host cell, incorporating both gp120 and gp41 proteins\u2014two types of viral proteins. Among them, gp41 is a transmembrane protein, while gp120 is the outer surface protein, forming a complex with gp41 through non-covalent interactions.","Type":"Enveloped virus","Introduction":"The virus that causes immunodeficiency in humans, known as HIV, belongs to the Lentivirus genus (a subgroup of retroviruses) that invades the human body. Over time, they induce the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),[1][2] a condition where the immune system progressively weakens, allowing for the development of cancers and opportunistic infections.[3] Without treatment, the estimated average survival time for individuals infected with HIV ranges from 9 to 11 years, depending on the viral subtype.","Individual":"The HIV virion enters macrophages and CD4+ T cells by bringing the glycoproteins on its surface into contact with receptors on the target cell and subsequently fusing the viral outer envelope with the target cell membrane, releasing the capsid into the cell.","LinkImage":"\/Screen\/XML\/Image\/HIV.jpg","Id":2,"LinkImage2":"\/Screen\/XML\/Image\/hiv_Lifecycle.jpg","Structure":"Nucleic Acid + Capsid","LinkVideo":"Viruses\/src\/Data\/Video\/1.mp4","Name":"HIV"}]
